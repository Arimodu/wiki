# Quest Modding

## Preface

- This guide is for both Quest 1 and Quest 2.
- Nobody has yet been banned for modding.

::: danger DISCLAIMER
By choosing to use mods, you understand that:

- You may experience problems that don't exist in the vanilla game. 99.9% of bugs, crashes, and lag are due to mods.
- Mods are subject to being broken by updates and that's normal - be patient and respectful when this happens,
  as modders are volunteers with real lives.
- Beat Games aren't purposefully trying to break mods. They wish to work on the codebase and sometimes this breaks mods,
  but they are not out to kill mods.

Do not attack the game developers for issues related to mods, and vice versa -
modders and game developers are two separate groups. Just don't be a jerk ok.
:::

:::warning I watched a video tutorial on YouTube, but I got stuck/it didn't work. What gives?
We at BSMG **strongly** advise against using any video tutorials for modding. Often, we find that they are either
outdated or contain incomplete, erroneous, or straight up incorrect information.

Instead, you should follow the written guides here on the wiki or seek out help in the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods).

## Requirements

Since modding BeatSaber involves Installing APKs on your Quest, you will need an PC (Windows / Mac / Linux) or Android
Phone at least once.
To use Chromebooks and iOS devices such as iPhones or iPads you need to have a [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.com/).
When you have one, visit [Modding With a Raspberry Pi](./raspi-modding.md) to get started.

## Ways to mod BeatSaber

Currently there are two ways to mod you game. You can either use BMBF or QAVS (QuestAppVersionSwitcher).

#### QAVS

QAVS is recommended for people who are using an Android Phone or don't have access to a computer at all times.
It has build in downgrading which means you don't need to use a PC or Phone everytime you want to update BeatSaber
to the latest moddable version.
Visit [Modding With QAVS](./quest-modding-qavs.md) to get started.

#### BMBF

BMBF is similar to QAVS but lacks the downgrading option. It has a simpler UI than QAVS and is generally easier to
understand for beginners. If you want to use BMBF to mod, you will need a PC everytime you update BeatSaber.
Visit [Modding With BMBF](./quest-modding-bmbf.md) to get started.
