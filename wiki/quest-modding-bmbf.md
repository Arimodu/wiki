# Quest Modding using BMBF

## Before You Begin

If you haven't already, go to [Preparations](./quest-modding.md#preparations) and follow those steps.
You should now have Developer Mode enabled and SideQuest Advanced installed on your PC.
It's recommended to tape up the proximity sensor between the lenses of your Quest. This prevents it from
going into sleep mode during the modding process.

Make sure you do not have multiple accounts an your Quest! Modding currently doesn't work with multiple accounts.
You can add them back once the modding process is completed.

## Connecting Your Quest to SideQuest

Take a USB cable and connect your Quest to your PC. Inside your Quest, two dialogs should pop up (if you're doing this
step for the first time). One dialog asks for permission for the PC to access the Quest's files. Click "Accept".
The other dialog asks if you want to trust the computer. Click "Always Trust" so it doesn't show up again.

Once you've done that, open SideQuest. Look at the top left corner. If there is a green dot, everything is
working and your Quest is connected. If it is red, try reconnecting the Quest. Alternatively, restart SideQuest
and/or your PC or try a different cable.

## Installing BMBF

Navigate to the SideQuest start page within the app. You should find a search field there. Type "BMBF"
and press Enter. In the search results, you should see a program with a Unicors as the icon. Click the download/sideload
button. You will see a red notification at the top of the app indicating that the app is being installed. Once the installation
is complete, a green notification will appear in the top right corner.

## Downgrading BeatSaber

### Checking the Version

Launch BeatSaber and look at your feet. There should be a version number displayed. If it matches the currently
moddable version, you can skip the downgrading step. You can find the latest moddable version information in the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods).

### Downgrading the Game

#### Uninstalling BeatSaber

Open SideQuest. In the top right of the navigation bar, click the icon with nine squares. This will display all the apps
currently installed on your headset. Locate `com.beatgames.beatsaber` and click the settings icon on the
right. On the page that opens, there should be a button to uninstall BeatSaber. Click it and wait for SideQuest to
confirm the uninstallation.

#### Downloading the Downgraded Version

Visit [OculusDB](https://oculusdb.rui2015.me/id/2448060205267927) and click "Download Latest Moddable Version." If you encounter
a 404 error page, you need to log in with your Meta account [here](https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest). Save the
downloaded APK file to a location where you can easily locate it.

#### Installing the Downgraded Version

Open SideQuest again and click the Install APK icon (a box with an arrow pointing downward). An explorer window will
appear. Select the APK file you downloaded from OculusDB. Once the installation is complete, you can disconnect the
Quest from your PC.
